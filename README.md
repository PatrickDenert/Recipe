# Recipe
A cookbook with more functionality

features: select random recipe from archive, add recipes to archive, adjust serving sizes, allow user to input ingredients and get possible recipes from the archive

future plans:
1. bug fixes
2. restructure how instructions are stores
3. work on a gui
4. create a string parser to parse user inputs to prevents errors associated with typos and plural words

to use replace the path strings with the path to the recipe/instruction file on your pc
